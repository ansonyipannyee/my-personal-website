                Welcome to my first webpage. As you might be able to tell, this page
                deeply references the Notes app by Apple. <br />
                Much like Apple's design principles, I too strive to build
                minimalistic interfaces that facilitate effortless user interactions.
                Feel free to navigate through my webpage using the side bar. <br />

            <h2>Aspiring Web Developer</h2>
            <h3>
                As a recent Psychology graduate of the University of Melbourne, I have always 
                been facinated with the correlations of human behaviour and cognitive processes 
                behind the users interaction with websites and other types of interfaces. I believe that Psychology 
                is a crucial aspect of web development as it helps me, as an aspiring developer, to create websites
                that cater to the users' needs, preferences, and behaviours.
                Having said that, as a current Web Development student at Academy Xi, my goal is the implement these psychological principles
                 to help build meaningful interfaces that allow for accessible and positive user-centric experiences.
